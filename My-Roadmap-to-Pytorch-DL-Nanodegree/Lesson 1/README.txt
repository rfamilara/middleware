# Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program - Phase-1]

Course Outline
In this course, I have learned the basics of deep neural networks and how to build various models using PyTorch. There are hands-on experience building state-of-the-art deep learning models which I have practiced, tested and applied

1. Introduction to Neural Networks
   Learn the concepts behind deep learning and how we train deep neural networks with backpropagation.

2. Talking PyTorch with Soumith Chintala
   Cezanne Camacho and Soumith Chintala, the creator of PyTorch, chat about the past, present, and future of PyTorch.

3. Introduction to PyTorch
   Learn how to build deep neural networks with PyTorch
   Build a state-of-the-art model using a pre-trained network that classifies cat and dog images

4. Convolutional Neural Networks
   Here you'll learn about convolutional neural networks, powerful architectures for solving computer vision problems.
   Build and train an image classifier from scratch to classify dog breeds.

5. Style Transfer
   Use a trained network to transfer the style of one image to another image
   Implement the style transfer model from Gatys et al.

6. Recurrent Neural Networks
   Learn how to use recurrent neural networks to learn from sequences of data such as time series
   Build a recurrent network that learns from text and generates new text one character at a time

7. Sentiment Prediction with an RNN
   Build and train a recurrent network that can classify the sentiment of movie reviews

8. Deploying PyTorch Models
   Learn how to use PyTorch's Hybrid Frontend to convert models from Python to C++ for use in production
